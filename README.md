AngularJS + Intel App Framework samples developed using Intel XDK, demonstrate how `AppFramework` and `angularJS` can be used to create `Cordova` based webview apps.

The samples show how angular controller, templates, directives, routing and other features can be made to work when using Intel AppFramework as the UI framework.
